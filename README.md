# z-transform-visualization
The purpose of this project was to create a visualization of digital filter's transfer function. It accepts coefficients of digital filter as an input and then displays five forms
of visualization:
- amplitude response

- phase response
- graph displaying zeros and poles on the complex plane
- 3D view of Z-domain
- 3D view of Z-domain but limited to the unit circle
